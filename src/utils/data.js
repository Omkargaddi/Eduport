IKEAâ€™s AR app, for instance, lets customers place furniture in their living spaces, enhancing online shopping confidence. AR mirrors in stores provide interactive fitting experiences, bridging the gap between online and physical shopping. With 3D models and virtual try-ons, AR reduces return rates and increases customer satisfaction. As AR technology advances, it will continue shaping the future of retail.",

Low-code platforms are popular in businesses that need custom apps without extensive development resources. Companies can use them to automate workflows, build websites, and manage databases, reducing dependency on traditional developers. Although ideal for simple applications, low-code solutions face limitations in complex projects, making them a complementary tool rather than a replacement.",
